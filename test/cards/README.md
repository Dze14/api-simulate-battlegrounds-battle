Specific card tests are only done for cards that have specific behaviors, i.e. cards that require some hard-coded logic just for them (or for a small set of them). It includes auras (like Dire Wolf Alpha), specific behaviors (like Bolvar), etc.

It DOES NOT include generic behaviors like Taunt, Divine Shield or Cleave.
